    "#### The idea is to define the architecture of your Neural Network. It means to construct neurons, the weights between the neurons and the biases attached to all the neurons, except for the first layer (i.e., the Input Layer).\n",
    "#### 1.1 Define the parameters\n",
    "#### As we have seen in the lecture, the parameters of a neural network are the weights and biases associated with the neurons.\n",
    "#### 1) Define the variables NI (input neuron), NH (Neuron in the Hidden layer),and NO (output neuron). Then define w11 the weight between NI and NH, and $w_{21}$ the weight between NH and NO. Finally define the 2 biases, $b_H$ and $b_O$ associated to NH and NO."
